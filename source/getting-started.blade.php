<h4 id="developers" class="text-blue-darkest">Developers</h4>
<p>Epay has also been designed for developers. If you are a developer, Epay has been designed to allow you extend and easily integrate into systems in order to accept payment without thinking of the risk that comes with processing payments.</p>
<p>Our well designed and beautiful checkout pages allows you to accept payments for your one-time purchase products and services, and notifies you via webhook whenever a new payment comes through. You donâ€™t need to write a single line of payment code, you only need to worry about how to respond when a payment is successful or not.
